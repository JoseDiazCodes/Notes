# Express in Node.js: A Deep Dive

Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features to develop web and mobile applications. It facilitates the rapid development of Node based web applications.

## Installation

Before you start using Express, you need to have Node.js and npm (node package manager) installed on your machine. If you haven't installed them yet, you can download and install them from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

Once Node.js and npm are installed, you can install Express using npm:

```sh
npm install express --save
```

The `--save` flag adds express as a dependency in your `package.json` file.

## Hello World Example

Let’s start with a simple "Hello World" application.

First, create a file named `app.js`, and then add the following code to it:

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
	res.send("Hello World!");
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
	console.log("Server is running on port 3000");
});
```

In this example, we are creating a basic web server that listens on port 3000. When you access the server at http://localhost:3000/, it will send "Hello World!" as a response.

## Routing

Routing refers to determining how an application responds to a client’s request to a particular endpoint, which is a URI (or path) and a specific HTTP request method (GET, POST, etc.).

Each route can have one or more handler functions, which are executed when the route is matched.

### Route Definition

Routes are defined using methods of the Express app object that correspond to HTTP methods; for example, `app.get()` to handle GET requests and `app.post()` to handle POST requests.

Here’s an example:

```javascript
app.get("/users", (req, res) => {
	res.send("Get all users");
});

app.post("/users", (req, res) => {
	res.send("Create a new user");
});
```

In this example, we have two routes. The first one is responding to GET requests at `/users`, and the second one is responding to POST requests at `/users`.

### Route Parameters

Route parameters are named URL segments that are used to capture the values specified at their position in the URL. The captured values are populated in the `req.params` object, with the name of the route parameter specified in the path as their respective keys.

Example:

```javascript
app.get("/users/:userId", (req, res) => {
	res.send(`Get user with ID ${req.params.userId}`);
});
```

## Middleware

Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next function in the application’s request-response cycle. These functions can execute code, make changes to the request and the response objects, end the request-response cycle, and call the next function in the stack.

If the current middleware function does not end the request-response cycle, it must call `next()` to pass control to the next middleware function. Otherwise, the request will be left hanging.

### Using Middleware

Here’s an example of how to use middleware:

```javascript
const myLogger = (req, res, next) => {
	console.log("LOGGED");
	next();
};

app.use(myLogger);
```

In this example, `myLogger` is a simple middleware function that just prints “LOGGED” to the console. You can add as many middleware functions as you want to the stack, and they will be executed in the order they are added.

## Starting the Server

The `app.listen()` method binds and listens for connections on the specified host and port. This method is identical to Node’s `http.createServer()`.

Example:

```javascript
app.listen(3000, () => {
	console.log("Example app listening on port 3000!");
});
```

## Conclusion

This guide provides an in-depth introduction to using Express in Node.js. By following the examples provided, you should have a good understanding of how to create routes, handle different types of HTTP requests, use middleware, and start an Express server.

Remember, this is just the tip of the iceberg. Express has a lot more features and capabilities that you can explore in the [official Express documentation](https://expressjs.com/).
