# ðŸ“š My Technical Notes Repository

Welcome to my notes repository! This is where I compile and share my understanding of various technical topics I am currently exploring. From Object-Oriented Programming concepts like Polymorphism to deep dives into JavaScript, you'll find a curated collection of my learning journey.

## ðŸ“– What's Inside?

- **OOP Concepts**: Delve into the foundations of Object-Oriented Programming with notes on Polymorphism and more.
- **JavaScript**: Detailed notes and code snippets on essential concepts from sources like "Eloquent JavaScript".
- **Project Breakdowns**: Insights into projects I've tackled, such as the NASA API Picture Fetcher.

## ðŸ¤“ How to Navigate

Each topic or project has its dedicated Markdown file. For example:

- `Polymorphism.md`: Notes on the polymorphism concept in OOP.
- `EloquentJS_Chapter6.md`: A deep dive into Chapter 6 of "Eloquent JavaScript".
- `NASA_API_PictureFetcher.md`: An outline and breakdown of the NASA API Picture Fetcher project.

Feel free to explore, and I hope you find these notes helpful!
